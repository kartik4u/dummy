In between, the outgoing chancellor smiled, chatted and shook the hands of 238 Rotman Commerce graduates as they walked across the stage – but not before encouraging them to add volunteer service to their career aspirations.

“Whether it’s in a service club, hospital, children’s sports, charitable organizations helping those in need, there are many ways to give back to our communities, strengthening them as well as ourselves,” said Wilson, who, wearing his black and gold robe and mortar board, was also the ceremony’s convocation speaker.

“It’s also a way of gratefully acknowledging the benefits of the good education you’ve received here at the University of Toronto.”

It was a fitting message from U of T’s 33rd chancellor, who was first elected for a three-year term in 2012 and renewed for a second term of equal length in 2015 – the maximum allowed by the University of Toronto Act. Though Wilson is best known for his accomplished career in the private and public sector – including as Canada’s minister of finance and ambassador to the United States – his most lasting impact may well be through his work with numerous professional and community organizations.","University of Toronto Chancellor Michael Wilson’s final convocation ceremony began, as it has many dozens of times before, with his official proclamations – in English and Latin – and ended with a surprise, student-led musical tribute.
